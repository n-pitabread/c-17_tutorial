# cpp17_tutorial

A tutorial for c++17. It contains some of the interesting features of c++17 in my opinion :+1:, such as Fold expression.
## Compile the tutorial

First, you will need to install c++ complier on your machine. In this tutorial, I am using g++ complier. In can be done as follow:

In Ubuntu,
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++
```
> Make sure the version you installed support c++17

After you install the complier, The tutorial can be complier with

```
g++ -std=c++17 <filename.cpp> -o <outputfile.o>
```
where `<filename.cpp>` will be the cppfile that you want to compile and `<outputfile.o>` is the output file you will use to run using command as follow:

```
./<outputfile.o>
```
